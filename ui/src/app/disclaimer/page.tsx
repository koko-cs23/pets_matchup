              While we strive to provide a platform where pet owners can connect
              and find suitable mates for their pets, we cannot guarantee the
              compatibility of any given match. Compatibility depends on various
              factors including the pets&apos; personalities, behaviors, and
              other variables beyond our control. We strongly recommend that you
              consult with a veterinarian or professional pet behaviorist before
              introducing any new pets to each other.
